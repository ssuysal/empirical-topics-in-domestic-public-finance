# Pay Transparency and Racial Wage Gaps in the U.S. Labor Market

This repository contains the research project analyzing the impact of state-level pay transparency laws on wage levels and racial wage gaps in the United States.

## Project Overview

This study examines how pay transparency legislation affects wage outcomes for Black and White workers across five U.S. states: Maryland, Nevada, Colorado, California, and Washington. Using individual-level Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 2010–2024, the research employs a staggered difference-in-differences design to account for the varied timing of policy implementation across states.

## Key Findings

- Pay transparency laws led to notable wage gains for Black workers, particularly Black women
- Significant reduction in the racial wage gap following implementation of transparency policies
- Evidence supporting the potential of transparency policies to promote pay equity in the labor market
